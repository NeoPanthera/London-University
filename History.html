<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London Inc. is a family run business that has spread it's reach to many corners of Lititz over many generations. The history of London Inc. began when Sam London arrived in Lititz in 1941 to escape the persecution he faced in Germany because of his Jewish background. It was here that he decided to start his own business a pizzeria, naming it the London Pizzaria. The London Pizzaria was very successful.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam London had 3 children: Ellen London, Matt London, and Randy London. These three intelligent children revolutionized our franchises as they became adults. Ellen went on to develop London Games, Matt went on to develop London Theater, and Randy continued to work in London Pizzaria.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London Games is currently managed Ellen's son, Daniel; London Theater is currently managed by Matt's son, Kevin; and London Pizzaria is currently managed by Randy's son, Mario.<br><br>

Matt had a second son, however, named Leo. After becoming an adult, Leo realized his calling and followed his destiny to move to London, England and establish London University.<br><br><br></table>
